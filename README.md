# dsci-100-project_minecraft

# Project Overview
This is an assignment for Data Science 100 at the University of British Columbia. The data for a Minecraft server was conducted by computer science students and we interested in creating a predictive question and conducting the necessary analysis to answer it.

# Research Problem and Objective
The research question is going to be based upon one of three broad prompts. 

1. What player characteristics and behaviours are most predictive of subscribing to a game-related newsletter, and how do these features differ between various player types?

2. We would like to know which "kinds" of players are most likely to contribute a large amount of data so that we can target those players in our recruiting efforts.

3. We are interested in demand forecasting, namely, what time windows are most likely to have large number of simultaneous players. This is because we need to ensure that the number of licenses on hand is sufficiently large to accommodate all parallel players with high probability. 

*Note that only one of these prompts will be further refined into a specific predictive question that our analysis and model will be built upon.*

# Data Description 
Our analysis will have two datasets available:

1. "players.csv" which contains demographic and behavourial data for individual players

2. "sessions.csv" which contains data about each play session.

# Now What?
Upon finishing this README file, go ahead to the analysis file to see the fruits of my labour!
