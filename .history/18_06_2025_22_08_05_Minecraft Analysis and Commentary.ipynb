    "# Introduction\n",
    "While computer science students are often thought of being swamped with course work and personal projects, they actually love spending free time on the world's most popular video game: Minecraft! \n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, a research group of computer science students at UBC loved playing Minecraft so much, they decided to collect data on how people play video games and if we can use the data derived from sessions to make certain predictions about player behaviour. Minecraft servers are expensive to setup and maintain. Thus, to faciliate the research effectively, they need to be able to target Minecraft enthusiasts while simultaneously making sure that they have enough server capacity on hand. \n",
    "\n",
    "Being a kind data scientist (and commerce student) myself, I thought to help the group identify which players have the potential to become engaged and interested in the broader project by uncovering the characteristics that are correlated to being a newsletter subscriber. "

    "# The Question \n",
    "The formal question this analysis attempts to answer is: Can player demographics, played hours and age, predict whether a new player is going to be a newsletter subscriber? Answering this question and determining the factors that affect if a new player will be subscriber can provide insightful information to the research group. \n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing which players are more inclined to subscribe helps the research group determine who to target to recruit to the Minecraft server. A key assumption made is that players who subscribe are also players who are more engaged in the broader project, which can lead to richer data collection (more sessions played, more responsiveness to surveys, etc). Another useful insight that the research group can obtain is that video games often have certain subscription services (battle pass in Fortnite, Nintendo game passes, etc) and perhaps knowing the factors that determine the subsciption rates of their Minecraft-related newsletter can help them gain intuition in subscribing tendencies of other games. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we know the question we are trying to solve, as well as the implications and benefits for the amazing group of UBC computer science students. Let us start the analysis (and code)!"
